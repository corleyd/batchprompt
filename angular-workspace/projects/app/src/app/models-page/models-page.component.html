<h1>Supported Models</h1>
<p>This page lists all available AI models grouped by provider, along with the credit cost per typical prompt and structured output support. Provider privacy summaries are included for reference.</p>

<h3>Credit Cost</h3>
<p>
  A "typical prompt" is defined as a prompt containing approximately 500 tokens with a corresponding response of around 750 tokens.
  One credit represents the cost of processing such a prompt using OpenAI’s baseline model, GPT 3.5 Turbo.
  Credit values for other models are scaled relative to this baseline to reflect their comparative capabilities and resource usage.
</p>
<h3>Structured Output</h3>
<p>
    Models that support structured output are designed to support the structured output feature in BatchPrompt. If a model does not support structured output, BatchPrompt will 
    add instructions to each prompt to simulate structured output. This means the model will generate a response that resembles structured data, but it may not be as reliable or
    consistent as true structured output. If you require structured output, we reccommend using models that explicitly support it.

        BatchPrompt uses the OpenAI API to generate prompt completions for OpenAI models. OpenAI states that when using OpenAI’s API, data submitted through the API is not used to 
        train or improve OpenAI’s models unless users explicitly opt in. BatchPrompt has not opted in. Additionally, OpenAI retains API data for 30 days for abuse and misuse monitoring before deletion.

        BatchPrompt uses the Google Cloud Vertex AI API to generate prompt completions for Google models. Google states that data submitted through the Vertex AI API is not used to train or improve Google’s models unless users explicitly opt in.
        BatchPrompt has not opted in. For more information, see <a href="https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/generative-ai/terms-of-service">Google’s Vertex AI terms of service</a>.

        <p>
            BatchPrompt uses the Amazon Bedrock API to generate prompt completions for AWS models. AWS states that data submitted through the Bedrock API is not used to train or improve AWS’s models unless users explicitly opt in.
            BatchPrompt has not opted in. For more information, see <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/terms/">AWS Bedrock terms of service</a>.

      <p>
        BatchPrompt uses the XAI API to generate prompt completions for XAI models. XAI states that data submitted through the XAI API is not used to train or improve XAI’s models unless users explicitly opt in.
        BatchPrompt has not opted in. For more information, see <a href="https://x.com/terms">XAI’s terms of service</a>.
